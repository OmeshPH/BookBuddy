Stretch Goals:
As time allows, complete the following stretch goals:

Utilize Google FontsLinks to an external site. to add a few to your project or to find fonts hosted elsewhere.
Add icons. Icon fonts allow you to add icons to your application, and common icons increase your user's ability to onboard to your application much more quickly. Check out Material IconsLinks to an external site. (used by adding <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" /> to your <head>), or Font AwesomeLinks to an external site..
Deploy the application to a hosted site.  For a refresher on how to do this, visit the Front End Deployment Guide.
